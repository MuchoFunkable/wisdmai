That means the economy has now recouped the 22 million jobs it lost during the pandemic. But while the labor market is going strong, there are concerns in the broader economy, chief among them persistently high inflation. Wall Street Journal labor economics reporter Sarah Chaney Cambon joins WSJ What’s News host Annmarie Fertoli to discuss.This transcript was prepared by a transcription service. This version may not be in its final form and may be updated.Annmarie Fertoli: US employers added 528,000 jobs to the economy in July, according to the Labor Department. After nearly two and a half years, the economy has now recouped the 22 million jobs it lost during the early days of the pandemic, and the unemployment rate now matches the half century low of three and a half percent that it also hit before the pandemic. But while the labor market is going strong, there are concerns in the broader economy, chief among them persistently high inflation. I\\'m Annmarie Fertoli from the Wall Street Journal, and joining me now to sort through this is Wall Street Journal labor economics reporter Sarah Chaney Cambon. Hi, Sarah. Thanks for being here.Sarah Chaney Cambon: Thanks so much for having me, Annmarie.Annmarie Fertoli: So, Sarah, we\\'ve been hearing a lot of concerns about an economic slowdown or a recession for the US economy, but what a pretty strong jobs report. Can you help us square those concerns with the latest data we\\'re seeing?Sarah Chaney Cambon: In the first two quarters of this year, GDP contracted but we\\'ve just seen incredibly strong job growth, which is very unusual. There\\'s been a lot of talk and concerns that we might be in a recession because the economy has contracted and we\\'ve seen slowdowns in consumer spending, which is very key for the economy. However, employers continue to hire, and a lot of that has to do with the fact that they just haven\\'t been able to find enough workers to meet demand even as demand slows.Annmarie Fertoli: So let\\'s talk a little bit more about that. The labor market has also been very tight these past few months, with open positions exceeding the number of those looking for employment. Are we seeing that start to ease at all?Sarah Chaney Cambon: There are some slight signs of easing. We saw that job openings actually fell a good bit in June. However, the labor market is still really tight, and we saw that again in Friday\\'s jobs report with the unemployment rate, which hit its pre-pandemic half century low of 3.5%. So companies are still competing pretty fiercely for workers.Annmarie Fertoli: We\\'ve been talking about how in a tight labor market, workers are having more leverage right now in terms of looking for jobs and demanding from employers what kind of benefits they want? What does the latest report tell us about the power workers have in this labor market right now?Sarah Chaney Cambon: It tells us that workers really continue to have a good bit of power. I mean, if you look at wage growth, which is kind of the sign of how much workers can really demand from employers in this market, it\\'s running above 5%, which is well above where it was before the pandemic was, about 3% then. So they\\'re still able to get wages. And, I mean, one downside in this current economy is clearly inflation. So inflation is outpacing wage growth, which is a concern for many workers. Some workers have already said that high inflation is driving them back into the labor force, particularly retirees, because they just can\\'t afford to keep up with the cost of living now. So some people are, quote, \"unretiring,\" for instance.Annmarie Fertoli: At the same time, we\\'re seeing several companies cutting staff. Which sectors are struggling right now?Sarah Chaney Cambon: We are seeing some anecdotal evidence that companies are cutting workers. We\\'ve seen some layoffs in the technology space. We\\'ve seen some retailers saying that they have overstaffed, and we\\'ve also seen some weakness in real estate. And a good bit of that has to do with companies are battling high inflation and Federal Reserve interest rate increases.Annmarie Fertoli: Right, so what does this latest report mean for the Fed, which has been raising interest rates to cool inflation while the labor market has been pretty strong?Sarah Chaney Cambon: The Fed has said that it wants to cool the labor market because the labor market is running too hot, essentially. And wage growth is one factor that drives up inflation, and the Fed wants inflation to come down. So the latest jobs report shows that we still have pretty high wage growth. The labor market is running strong and much stronger than a lot of economists expected, and so this will likely mean that the Federal Reserve will continue to raise interest rates.Annmarie Fertoli: What other trends are emerging from this report? What caught your attention?Sarah Chaney Cambon: I think the breadth of job growth is really interesting. At this point, a lot of sectors that we thought might be weakening, like technology, continued to show some strength. Technology shows up in several different sectors in this report, including information and professional and business services, and those sectors continued to add jobs in July. We also saw that even though the housing market is slowing down some, residential construction firms continue to add jobs in July. So it\\'s somewhat of a mystery why all of these sectors are doing so well still.Annmarie Fertoli: That\\'s Wall Street Journal labor economics reporter Sarah Chaney Cambon.

After nearly two and a half years, the economy has now recouped the 22 million jobs it lost during the early days of the pandemic, and the unemployment rate now matches the half century low of three and a half percent that it also hit before the pandemic. But while the labor market is going strong, there are concerns in the broader economy, chief among them persistently high inflation. I\\'m Annmarie Fertoli from the Wall Street Journal, and joining me now to sort through this is Wall Street Journal labor economics reporter Sarah Chaney Cambon. Hi, Sarah. Thanks for being here.Sarah Chaney Cambon: Thanks so much for having me, Annmarie.Annmarie Fertoli: So, Sarah, we\\'ve been hearing a lot of concerns about an economic slowdown or a recession for the US economy, but what a pretty strong jobs report. Can you help us square those concerns with the latest data we\\'re seeing?Sarah Chaney Cambon: In the first two quarters of this year, GDP contracted but we\\'ve just seen incredibly strong job growth, which is very unusual. There\\'s been a lot of talk and concerns that we might be in a recession because the economy has contracted and we\\'ve seen slowdowns in consumer spending, which is very key for the economy. However, employers continue to hire, and a lot of that has to do with the fact that they just haven\\'t been able to find enough workers to meet demand even as demand slows.Annmarie Fertoli: So let\\'s talk a little bit more about that. The labor market has also been very tight these past few months, with open positions exceeding the number of those looking for employment. Are we seeing that start to ease at all?Sarah Chaney Cambon: There are some slight signs of easing. We saw that job openings actually fell a good bit in June. However, the labor market is still really tight, and we saw that again in Friday\\'s jobs report with the unemployment rate, which hit its pre-pandemic half century low of 3.5%. So companies are still competing pretty fiercely for workers.Annmarie Fertoli: We\\'ve been talking about how in a tight labor market, workers are having more leverage right now in terms of looking for jobs and demanding from employers what kind of benefits they want? What does the latest report tell us about the power workers have in this labor market right now?Sarah Chaney Cambon: It tells us that workers really continue to have a good bit of power. I mean, if you look at wage growth, which is kind of the sign of how much workers can really demand from employers in this market, it\\'s running above 5%, which is well above where it was before the pandemic was, about 3% then. So they\\'re still able to get wages. And, I mean, one downside in this current economy is clearly inflation. So inflation is outpacing wage growth, which is a concern for many workers. Some workers have already said that high inflation is driving them back into the labor force, particularly retirees, because they just can\\'t afford to keep up with the cost of living now. So some people are, quote, \"unretiring,\" for instance.Annmarie Fertoli: At the same time, we\\'re seeing several companies cutting staff. Which sectors are struggling right now?Sarah Chaney Cambon: We are seeing some anecdotal evidence that companies are cutting workers. We\\'ve seen some layoffs in the technology space. We\\'ve seen some retailers saying that they have overstaffed, and we\\'ve also seen some weakness in real estate.

Can you help us square those concerns with the latest data we\\'re seeing?Sarah Chaney Cambon: In the first two quarters of this year, GDP contracted but we\\'ve just seen incredibly strong job growth, which is very unusual. There\\'s been a lot of talk and concerns that we might be in a recession because the economy has contracted and we\\'ve seen slowdowns in consumer spending, which is very key for the economy. However, employers continue to hire, and a lot of that has to do with the fact that they just haven\\'t been able to find enough workers to meet demand even as demand slows.Annmarie Fertoli: So let\\'s talk a little bit more about that. The labor market has also been very tight these past few months, with open positions exceeding the number of those looking for employment. Are we seeing that start to ease at all?Sarah Chaney Cambon: There are some slight signs of easing. We saw that job openings actually fell a good bit in June. However, the labor market is still really tight, and we saw that again in Friday\\'s jobs report with the unemployment rate, which hit its pre-pandemic half century low of 3.5%. So companies are still competing pretty fiercely for workers.Annmarie Fertoli: We\\'ve been talking about how in a tight labor market, workers are having more leverage right now in terms of looking for jobs and demanding from employers what kind of benefits they want? What does the latest report tell us about the power workers have in this labor market right now?Sarah Chaney Cambon: It tells us that workers really continue to have a good bit of power. I mean, if you look at wage growth, which is kind of the sign of how much workers can really demand from employers in this market, it\\'s running above 5%, which is well above where it was before the pandemic was, about 3% then. So they\\'re still able to get wages. And, I mean, one downside in this current economy is clearly inflation. So inflation is outpacing wage growth, which is a concern for many workers. Some workers have already said that high inflation is driving them back into the labor force, particularly retirees, because they just can\\'t afford to keep up with the cost of living now. So some people are, quote, \"unretiring,\" for instance.Annmarie Fertoli: At the same time, we\\'re seeing several companies cutting staff. Which sectors are struggling right now?Sarah Chaney Cambon: We are seeing some anecdotal evidence that companies are cutting workers. We\\'ve seen some layoffs in the technology space. We\\'ve seen some retailers saying that they have overstaffed, and we\\'ve also seen some weakness in real estate. And a good bit of that has to do with companies are battling high inflation and Federal Reserve interest rate increases.Annmarie Fertoli: Right, so what does this latest report mean for the Fed, which has been raising interest rates to cool inflation while the labor market has been pretty strong?Sarah Chaney Cambon: The Fed has said that it wants to cool the labor market because the labor market is running too hot, essentially. And wage growth is one factor that drives up inflation, and the Fed wants inflation to come down. So the latest jobs report shows that we still have pretty high wage growth. The labor market is running strong and much stronger than a lot of economists expected, and so this will likely mean that the Federal Reserve will continue to raise interest rates.Annmarie Fertoli: What other trends are emerging from this report? What caught your attention?Sarah Chaney Cambon: I think the breadth of job growth is really interesting. At this point, a lot of sectors that we thought might be weakening, like technology, continued to show some strength. Technology shows up in several different sectors in this report, including information and professional and business services, and those sectors continued to add jobs in July. We also saw that even though the housing market is slowing down some, residential construction firms continue to add jobs in July. So it\\'s somewhat of a mystery why all of these sectors are doing so well still.Annmarie Fertoli: That\\'s Wall Street Journal labor economics reporter Sarah Chaney Cambon.

After nearly two and a half years, the economy has now recouped the 22 million jobs it lost during the early days of the pandemic, and the unemployment rate now matches the half century low of three and a half percent that it also hit before the pandemic. But while the labor market is going strong, there are concerns in the broader economy, chief among them persistently high inflation. I\\'m Annmarie Fertoli from the Wall Street Journal, and joining me now to sort through this is Wall Street Journal labor economics reporter Sarah Chaney Cambon. Hi, Sarah. Thanks for being here.Sarah Chaney Cambon: Thanks so much for having me, Annmarie.Annmarie Fertoli: So, Sarah, we\\'ve been hearing a lot of concerns about an economic slowdown or a recession for the US economy, but what a pretty strong jobs report. Can you help us square those concerns with the latest data we\\'re seeing?Sarah Chaney Cambon: In the first two quarters of this year, GDP contracted but we\\'ve just seen incredibly strong job growth, which is very unusual. There\\'s been a lot of talk and concerns that we might be in a recession because the economy has contracted and we\\'ve seen slowdowns in consumer spending, which is very key for the economy. However, employers continue to hire, and a lot of that has to do with the fact that they just haven\\'t been able to find enough workers to meet demand even as demand slows.Annmarie Fertoli: So let\\'s talk a little bit more about that. The labor market has also been very tight these past few months, with open positions exceeding the number of those looking for employment. Are we seeing that start to ease at all?Sarah Chaney Cambon: There are some slight signs of easing. We saw that job openings actually fell a good bit in June. However, the labor market is still really tight, and we saw that again in Friday\\'s jobs report with the unemployment rate, which hit its pre-pandemic half century low of 3.5%. So companies are still competing pretty fiercely for workers.Annmarie Fertoli: We\\'ve been talking about how in a tight labor market, workers are having more leverage right now in terms of looking for jobs and demanding from employers what kind of benefits they want? What does the latest report tell us about the power workers have in this labor market right now?Sarah Chaney Cambon: It tells us that workers really continue to have a good bit of power. I mean, if you look at wage growth, which is kind of the sign of how much workers can really demand from employers in this market, it\\'s running above 5%, which is well above where it was before the pandemic was, about 3% then. So they\\'re still able to get wages. And, I mean, one downside in this current economy is clearly inflation. So inflation is outpacing wage growth, which is a concern for many workers. Some workers have already said that high inflation is driving them back into the labor force, particularly retirees, because they just can\\'t afford to keep up with the cost of living now. So some people are, quote, \"unretiring,\" for instance.Annmarie Fertoli: At the same time, we\\'re seeing several companies cutting staff. Which sectors are struggling right now?Sarah Chaney Cambon: We are seeing some anecdotal evidence that companies are cutting workers. We\\'ve seen some layoffs in the technology space. We\\'ve seen some retailers saying that they have overstaffed, and we\\'ve also seen some weakness in real estate. And a good bit of that has to do with companies are battling high inflation and Federal Reserve interest rate increases.Annmarie Fertoli: Right, so what does this latest report mean for the Fed, which has been raising interest rates to cool inflation while the labor market has been pretty strong?Sarah Chaney Cambon: The Fed has said that it wants to cool the labor market because the labor market is running too hot, essentially. And wage growth is one factor that drives up inflation, and the Fed wants inflation to come down. So the latest jobs report shows that we still have pretty high wage growth. The labor market is running strong and much stronger than a lot of economists expected, and so this will likely mean that the Federal Reserve will continue to raise interest rates.Annmarie Fertoli: What other trends are emerging from this report?

So companies are still competing pretty fiercely for workers.Annmarie Fertoli: We\\'ve been talking about how in a tight labor market, workers are having more leverage right now in terms of looking for jobs and demanding from employers what kind of benefits they want? What does the latest report tell us about the power workers have in this labor market right now?Sarah Chaney Cambon: It tells us that workers really continue to have a good bit of power. I mean, if you look at wage growth, which is kind of the sign of how much workers can really demand from employers in this market, it\\'s running above 5%, which is well above where it was before the pandemic was, about 3% then. So they\\'re still able to get wages. And, I mean, one downside in this current economy is clearly inflation. So inflation is outpacing wage growth, which is a concern for many workers. Some workers have already said that high inflation is driving them back into the labor force, particularly retirees, because they just can\\'t afford to keep up with the cost of living now. So some people are, quote, \"unretiring,\" for instance.Annmarie Fertoli: At the same time, we\\'re seeing several companies cutting staff. Which sectors are struggling right now?Sarah Chaney Cambon: We are seeing some anecdotal evidence that companies are cutting workers. We\\'ve seen some layoffs in the technology space. We\\'ve seen some retailers saying that they have overstaffed, and we\\'ve also seen some weakness in real estate. And a good bit of that has to do with companies are battling high inflation and Federal Reserve interest rate increases.Annmarie Fertoli: Right, so what does this latest report mean for the Fed, which has been raising interest rates to cool inflation while the labor market has been pretty strong?Sarah Chaney Cambon: The Fed has said that it wants to cool the labor market because the labor market is running too hot, essentially. And wage growth is one factor that drives up inflation, and the Fed wants inflation to come down. So the latest jobs report shows that we still have pretty high wage growth. The labor market is running strong and much stronger than a lot of economists expected, and so this will likely mean that the Federal Reserve will continue to raise interest rates.Annmarie Fertoli: What other trends are emerging from this report? What caught your attention?Sarah Chaney Cambon: I think the breadth of job growth is really interesting. At this point, a lot of sectors that we thought might be weakening, like technology, continued to show some strength. Technology shows up in several different sectors in this report, including information and professional and business services, and those sectors continued to add jobs in July. We also saw that even though the housing market is slowing down some, residential construction firms continue to add jobs in July. So it\\'s somewhat of a mystery why all of these sectors are doing so well still.Annmarie Fertoli: That\\'s Wall Street Journal labor economics reporter Sarah Chaney Cambon.

Thanks for being here.Sarah Chaney Cambon: Thanks so much for having me, Annmarie.Annmarie Fertoli: So, Sarah, we\\'ve been hearing a lot of concerns about an economic slowdown or a recession for the US economy, but what a pretty strong jobs report. Can you help us square those concerns with the latest data we\\'re seeing?Sarah Chaney Cambon: In the first two quarters of this year, GDP contracted but we\\'ve just seen incredibly strong job growth, which is very unusual. There\\'s been a lot of talk and concerns that we might be in a recession because the economy has contracted and we\\'ve seen slowdowns in consumer spending, which is very key for the economy. However, employers continue to hire, and a lot of that has to do with the fact that they just haven\\'t been able to find enough workers to meet demand even as demand slows.Annmarie Fertoli: So let\\'s talk a little bit more about that. The labor market has also been very tight these past few months, with open positions exceeding the number of those looking for employment.

After nearly two and a half years, the economy has now recouped the 22 million jobs it lost during the early days of the pandemic, and the unemployment rate now matches the half century low of three and a half percent that it also hit before the pandemic. But while the labor market is going strong, there are concerns in the broader economy, chief among them persistently high inflation. I\\'m Annmarie Fertoli from the Wall Street Journal, and joining me now to sort through this is Wall Street Journal labor economics reporter Sarah Chaney Cambon. Hi, Sarah. Thanks for being here.Sarah Chaney Cambon: Thanks so much for having me, Annmarie.Annmarie Fertoli: So, Sarah, we\\'ve been hearing a lot of concerns about an economic slowdown or a recession for the US economy, but what a pretty strong jobs report. Can you help us square those concerns with the latest data we\\'re seeing?Sarah Chaney Cambon: In the first two quarters of this year, GDP contracted but we\\'ve just seen incredibly strong job growth, which is very unusual. There\\'s been a lot of talk and concerns that we might be in a recession because the economy has contracted and we\\'ve seen slowdowns in consumer spending, which is very key for the economy. However, employers continue to hire, and a lot of that has to do with the fact that they just haven\\'t been able to find enough workers to meet demand even as demand slows.Annmarie Fertoli: So let\\'s talk a little bit more about that. The labor market has also been very tight these past few months, with open positions exceeding the number of those looking for employment. Are we seeing that start to ease at all?Sarah Chaney Cambon: There are some slight signs of easing. We saw that job openings actually fell a good bit in June. However, the labor market is still really tight, and we saw that again in Friday\\'s jobs report with the unemployment rate, which hit its pre-pandemic half century low of 3.5%. So companies are still competing pretty fiercely for workers.Annmarie Fertoli: We\\'ve been talking about how in a tight labor market, workers are having more leverage right now in terms of looking for jobs and demanding from employers what kind of benefits they want? What does the latest report tell us about the power workers have in this labor market right now?Sarah Chaney Cambon: It tells us that workers really continue to have a good bit of power. I mean, if you look at wage growth, which is kind of the sign of how much workers can really demand from employers in this market, it\\'s running above 5%, which is well above where it was before the pandemic was, about 3% then. So they\\'re still able to get wages. And, I mean, one downside in this current economy is clearly inflation. So inflation is outpacing wage growth, which is a concern for many workers. Some workers have already said that high inflation is driving them back into the labor force, particularly retirees, because they just can\\'t afford to keep up with the cost of living now. So some people are, quote, \"unretiring,\" for instance.Annmarie Fertoli: At the same time, we\\'re seeing several companies cutting staff. Which sectors are struggling right now?Sarah Chaney Cambon: We are seeing some anecdotal evidence that companies are cutting workers. We\\'ve seen some layoffs in the technology space. We\\'ve seen some retailers saying that they have overstaffed, and we\\'ve also seen some weakness in real estate. And a good bit of that has to do with companies are battling high inflation and Federal Reserve interest rate increases.Annmarie Fertoli: Right, so what does this latest report mean for the Fed, which has been raising interest rates to cool inflation while the labor market has been pretty strong?Sarah Chaney Cambon: The Fed has said that it wants to cool the labor market because the labor market is running too hot, essentially. And wage growth is one factor that drives up inflation, and the Fed wants inflation to come down. So the latest jobs report shows that we still have pretty high wage growth. The labor market is running strong and much stronger than a lot of economists expected, and so this will likely mean that the Federal Reserve will continue to raise interest rates.Annmarie Fertoli: What other trends are emerging from this report? What caught your attention?Sarah Chaney Cambon: I think the breadth of job growth is really interesting. At this point, a lot of sectors that we thought might be weakening, like technology, continued to show some strength. Technology shows up in several different sectors in this report, including information and professional and business services, and those sectors continued to add jobs in July. We also saw that even though the housing market is slowing down some, residential construction firms continue to add jobs in July. So it\\'s somewhat of a mystery why all of these sectors are doing so well still.Annmarie Fertoli: That\\'s Wall Street Journal labor economics reporter Sarah Chaney Cambon.
