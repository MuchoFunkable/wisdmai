From what I see, they’re practically inescapable and on avg each person reading this thread probably contributes hundreds of dollars to each of their top lines yearly, either directly or indirectly.\n\n3. For the ones that are less “gold plated” when it comes to the core of their business aka Meta and Netflix, they are currently trading at much much saner multiples than before, especially Meta, and still are solid businesses with moats and tons of FCF. \n\nI feel Netflix still offers the best service amongst the streaming platforms and is an innovative enough company to maintain its profitability and growth. It also has streaming as its core bread and butter business unlike AMZN and arguably Disney. \n\nRe: Meta, Metaverse may look like a weird bet but the VR/AR tech they’re investing in is absolutely industry leading and FB ads still have a massive moat in digital advertising thanks to Insta. Current valuation is a bargain when you consider their profits and growth. \n\nHence, I feel there’s a decent rational logic to buying these stocks over the next year or so keeping a 10 year + horizon in mind.
